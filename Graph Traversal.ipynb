    "## Introduction\n",
    "This objective of this program focuses on constructing an evolutionary tree using the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) algorithm to examine the fundamentals of graph traversal. UPGMA is a key bioinformatics tool for analyzing genetic relationships by clustering sequences based on their edit distances. Starting with a set of sequences from Neanderthals, humans, and primates, we leverage dynamic programming to compute pairwise edit distances and organize them into a distance matrix. The UPGMA algorithm then iteratively merges the closest clusters, updating the matrix until all sequences are grouped into a single tree. The final output, a list of clusters, represents the inferred evolutionary relationships. Through the implementation of these algorithms, we discern the role of computational methods in understanding genetic evolution and demonstrate UPGMA's effectiveness in phylogenetic analysis."

    "### Edit Distance\n",
    "Here we first implement the edit distance algorithm that leverages dynamic programming in order to reduce computational strain. Similar to previous implementation, we save essential edit distance values in a matrix of size (n + 1) x (m + 1) with n being the length of the input string and m being the length of the desired string. We then fill the top row and left-most column of the matrix according to the deletion costs and insertion costs respectively. We use those values to calculate the remaining values within the matrix and find the total edit distance as the matrix value [n+1, m+1], which we return."

    "### UPGMA Algorithm\n",
    "The UPGMA algorithm is the main focus of this program and is what we utilize in order to construct our evolutionary tree. We initialize the UPGMA algorithm as a class, with each genetic sequence as a separate cluster as well as the edit distance matrix. Following this, we iteratively find the species pair with the smallest edit distance, merge the two, and update the rest of the distance matrix using the average distance formula. We also track these merges to construct a tree data structure in which each merge creates an edges from the new cluster to the merged clusters. Throughout this process, we record each step and updated distance matrix for later reference. Aside from the UPGMA class implementation that includes methods to find the minimum edit distance pair and merge clusters, we create functions to output the tree edges, algorithm history, and final tree, with a utility function to generate matrix labels."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This assignment demonstrated the effectiveness of the UPGMA algorithm in constructing evolutionary trees from genetic sequence data. By calculating edit distances and iteratively clustering sequences, we revealed evolutionary relationships, with closely related species showing smaller distances and more distant species exhibiting greater divergence. The step-by-step merging process provided clear insights into genetic history, highlighting UPGMA's utility in phylogenetic analysis. This exercise reinforced the importance of computational methods in evolutionary biology and laid the groundwork for exploring more advanced techniques in the future.\n",
